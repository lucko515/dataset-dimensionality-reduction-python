# Wine reduction using PCA

What if we have supervised dataset? In that case instead of using the PCA we are going to use the LDA algorithm. Here, in this mini project, I am demonstrating how to do that in practice.

## Dataset

Dataset used in this mini project can be found inside the folder for this project.
